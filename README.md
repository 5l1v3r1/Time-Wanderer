# Time-Wanderer
This was a project for "Videogames Technology", a subject in the Degree of Computer Science.
Even though that subject was over, we're proud of this project and want to continue working on it (or, at least, so do I..).

# Project run
Once the distribution release is downloaded (coming soon, I hope...), it should be run on any O.S. with the command (on the _.jar_ folder):

    java -jar Time-Wanderer
or just double click over the _.jar_ file.

Maybe it can take some time (like 5-10 seconds) to load. We're working on it...

If the entire source is wanted, just clone the entire repository and compile it.

    git clone https://github.com/Foo-Manroot/Time-Wanderer
